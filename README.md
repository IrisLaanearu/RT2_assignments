# Research Track 2 Assignments
This README will give an overview of the Research Track 2 Assignments. In total there will be 3 Assignments and the Research Line.

## Assignment 1: Documentation of Research Track 1 second assignment
In order to properly document the second assignment of Research Track 1 course the Sphynx (documentation for software projects) is used because the software language used is python. Sphynx was originally created for Python and therefore better supports the documentation of this project.

The documentation of Research Track 1 assignment can be found here: https://irislaanearu.github.io/RT2_assignments/
