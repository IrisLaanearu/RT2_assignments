# Research Track 2 Assignments
This README will give an overview of the Research Track 2 Assignments. In total there will be 3 Assignments and the Research Line.

## Assignment 1: Documentation of Research Track 1 second assignment
In order to properly document the second assignment of Research Track 1 course the Sphynx (documentation for software projects) is used because the software language used is python. Sphynx was originally created for Python and therefore better supports the documentation of this project.

The documentation of Research Track 1 assignment can be found here: https://irislaanearu.github.io/RT2_assignments/

## Assignment 2: Using widgets and data visualization for the Research Track 1 second assignment
In this assignment:
- Created a jupyter notebook to replace the user interface (node A)
- Using widgets to let the user know the position of the robot and all targets that have been set and cancelled in the environment
- Used FuncAnimation to plot the robot position
- Added a plot for the number of reached/not-reached targets

In the end, the notebook has:
- an interface to assign (or cancel) goals to the robot
- a plot with the robot´s position and target´s positions in the environment
- a plot for the number of reached/not-reached targets

To use the created jupyter notebook follow these steps:
1. Download Jupyter notebook using the following command:
```bash
$ pip install jupyter
```
